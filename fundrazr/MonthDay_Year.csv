"On May 15th, 2017 I was in an ATV accident resulting in a surgery to
  place a plate and screws into my leg. On July 1st a severe bone
  infection was discovered and treatment with IV antibiotics began. I
  was then transported from a hospital in Pagosa Springs, CO to San Juan
  Regional Medical Center in Farmington, NM. Since my initial operation
  on May 15th, she has had 9 operations and will have at least 3 more. The first was to clean the wound. The second was a follow-up surgery
  to ensure maximum cleanliness. After a couple of days, the doctor
  noticed a blister that forming on my wound so he preformed another
  operation. This time, to remove the plate and 8 screws that had gotten
  infected. The doctors later found that my bone had started getting
  infected where the hardware was initially placed so they performed
  another surgery to put an antibiotic rod in her bone meant to treat my
  inner bone infection. The last 9 months have been some of the most physically painful days
  I’ve ever had to face to date and I will need additional surgeries to
  get a bone graph and to remove this external fixator that I currently
  have on my right leg. I will have to wear this fixator for 8 more
  months to ensure my leg heals correctly. It has been painful both
  mentally and physically. This would've been my 8th year as a wildland firefighter, which is a
  major source of my primary income. I am and be unemployed until my
  recovery is complete. The monies being raised are to assist my family with gas, food, and
  lodging as they travel three hours each way to and from Dulce, NM to
  Albuquerque, NM for additional appointments as well as surgeries. They
  will also assist myself with bills as I am unable to work during my
  recovery period. I am a member of the Jicarilla Apache Nation and International
  Indigenous Youth Council. I defended the water for several weeks in
  Standing Rock, ND and recently completed a lengthy art project for
  Honor the Earth. Any support to help me as I recover this period is
  greatly appreciated. Please help me get back on my feet so I can help

"Brad and Jessica had their whole future planned.  He proposed to her
  in Punta Cana and were finalizing the plans of their September
  wedding.  Brad is a manager and known to be a dedicated hard worker in
  his fathers company, Abell Custom Marine.  Jessica is an office
  manager and surgical technician.  This beautiful young couple
  purchased a home together and had big plans for their new life
  together.....that all changed in an instant on April 14th when they
  were involved in a devastating automobile accident. Brad and Jessica were on their way back to Maryland from Ohio when a
  semi truck and trailer ran a stop sign causing Brad and Jessica's SUV
  to TBone the trailer head on. They were pinned under a trailer 
  carrying steel beams for over an hour until first responders could
  extract them.  The pictures are horrific and hard to look at it.  But
  it's the only way to see how truly lucky they were. It is a miracle they survived such a violent accident and their road
  to recovery is a long one...but at least they have a road.  Everyone
  who knows them feel truly blessed that somehow their lives were spared. Brad, an active outgoing young man,  suffered multiple compound
  fractures in both arms, shattered elbow, a fractured foot,  a severe
  concussion, multiple deep facial lacerations and almost every bone in
  his face is fractured.  He has already endured 2 extensive surgeries
  and more are scheduled. He will need facial reconstruction surgeries. 
  Jessica, can only be described as someone who can light up the darkest
  day has a fractured vertebrate, fractured cheek, multiple lacerations
  and head trauma.  She is improving every day but has a long ways to go. This fundraiser is set up to raise funds to help Brad and Jessica
  with their expenses during their long road to recovery.  Brad and
  Jessica's  severe and incapacitating injuries will prevent them from
  returning back to work anytime in the foreseeable future.  They both
  will have to extensive rehab and therapy. Our goal is to raise enough funds to cover their mortgage payment,
  living expenses and assistance for the next 12 months.  We want Brad
  and Jessica to only concentrate on their recovery and not worry about
  how they will pay their bills or if they will lose their home.  Any
  funds leftover will go towards medical, rehabilitation and physical
  therapy bills that are growing at an alarming rate. We are also planning a live fundraiser at a date to be determined to
  help us reach our goal. Please consider donating today.  Please share with family and friends! .....and please count your blessings and be thankful for every happy
  and healthy day you have as you never know what tomorrow will bring. #abellstrong Funds from this fundraiser will be managed by Brad's father Jeff
    Abell and Jessie's Mom Dawn Connell. All funds will go strictly to
    only paying expenses for Brad and Jessica.  For questions or

"In July 2014, 2-year-old Eve McGonigle was diagnosed with an
  extremely rare and life-threatening brain tumour called Ependymoma.
  After weeks of mis-diagnosis, Eve was extremely ill, struggling to
  walk, talk or even eat. The life was sucked out of her and it was
  agonising to see the once mischevious and adorable toddler struggling
  to survive. Eve's condition drastically deteriorated and after a visit
  to the Borders General Hospital was rushed to Edinburgh's Sick Kids
  for emergency treatment after a brain scan determined the unthinkable.
  This was truly devastating and soul destroying for Eve's family who
  could only rally around and pray for a miracle, whilst Eve lay almost
  unrecognisable in a ward bursting with other young children fighting
  for their lives. Upon arriving at the hospital, Eve was taken in and cared for by the
  magical staff and nurses of Ward 7. The procedures and life-saving
  treatment that Eve required were terrifying for both Eve and her
  family, however the miraculous nurses and medical staff were
  constantly on hand 24 hours a day to help with their calming and
  loving nature, somehow helping to make the six week stint in a stark
  hospital bed bearable. These people dedicate their lives to ensure the
  young children that enter the ward have the very best chance of making
  it out in full health, so we want to give something back. EVEolution has been set up to help the staff and patients of Ward 7
  to improve the facilities on the ward to allow children fighting this
  deadly disease and their families find some sort of comfort and solace
  throughout this stressful time. If you would like to help us make a difference we would be forever
  grateful knowing that with your generous support we have made a
  difference to help future children like Eve and their families having
  to battle through this terrifying experience. When you are smacked in
  the face with a heartbreaking matter such as Eve's we know it would
  make a difference to find a little more comfort in an alien environment. We will keep you up to date with projects on our twitter and Facebook page.

"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living. We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!","28,579",of $40k goal,https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor,Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,139,"Jul 6, 2018",Canadian Dollar
"Smart, beautiful, loving, and caring. This is Marius! Since the age of 18, Marius was passionate about school, especially
  math and economics, going to school was the one thing he really wanted
  to do. Marius was so committed to his goals that he worked every day
  to earn the money he needed to go to college; he was determined not to
  just go to school, but to earn a Master’s degree in accounting. When
  he was done with school he planned on opening up an accounting office. Marius’s dream came to a screeching halt in 2016 when he was
  diagnosed with a serious illness. He suddenly found himself at the
  mercy of the medical establishment and as found that his employer
  would not accommodate the time Marius needed off from work to get
  treatment, so he lost his job. Even with this, Marius was not a quitter; his finals for his Master’s
  degree were right around the corner. Even though Marius felt dejected
  and his health was failing he finished his degree with honors. After completing his degree, and with renewed hope Marius set out to
  fight the illness that was ravaging his body, just like he had set out
  to go to school and get his degree. As he saw various doctors, it
  became clear that the prognosis was not good and that he needed to
  have surgery to stop the spread of the disease, which now had a name,
  cancer. Though Marius had never smoked and was not a drinker, he had
  Oral Cancer and only a radical surgery could save him. People often believe that you can’t get Oral Cancer unless you smoke,
  chew tobacco, drink excessively or have other lifestyle risk factors,
  but the American Cancer Society says 35% of the people who get this
  type of cancer have no risk factors. That means of the 100,000 people who get Oral Cancer every year, many
  never even imagined they could get the disease, because they weren’t
  doing any of the things they believe cause cancer. Men are also
  disproportionately affected by oral cancer with twice the risk for the
  disfiguring disease as women. Cancer is such a pervasive disease that almost everyone knows someone
  who has faced the disease. Our campaign “Save a Life Today -
    Marius Needs A Hero” is raising money needed to halt the
  rapid advance of cancer. One of the battles patients face with this cancer is that insurance
  does not always cover all of the surgery. Marius is facing this
  situation and as a young recent college graduate, with no income, he
  has to find a way to pay for his treatment. Already he has sought out
  every option for free treatment, but he has not found a program he
  qualifies for. In fact most options require him to be in the final
  stages of cancer where death is imminent to get help. The money that we hope to raise will cover the entire costs of
    surgery and treatment plan. This treatment plan includes full
    surgical removal of the cancerous cells and will also remove all of
    Marius’s teeth. Then, the reconstruction of Marius’s mouth and face,
    including implanting 14 teeth. Completing this surgery quickly will
    mean that Marius can avoid radiation and chemo therapy. If you ever wanted to be someone’s hero, YOU CAN, right now for
  Marius!  Instead of making a donation to a large organization where
  you hope it will help someone, you will be able to see the progress
  Marius makes as see how much of an impact your donation makes. You
  will be able to have a direct and positive impact on Marius’s life and
  help him move on from cancer into being a productive contributing
  member of society. Make a change in Marius’s lifer NOW and click on that donate button ! To thank everyone for their support and care, Marius will be sending
  every one of his donors a copy of the novel he wrote called “Unspoken
  Words”. Right now Marius’s book has touched many lives and he has more
  than 10,000 5 star reviews. Help Marius to keep touching lives, but donating and sharing Marius’s
  Fundraising link on Facebook, Twitter and all of your other social
  media. Every Share will be a chance that another person with big heart
  , LIKE YOU , to make a donation and his life to be save it! WE CAN AND HAVE THE POWER TO SAVE MARIUS`S LIFE! Everyone has

"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within three weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your sample to us, the samples will be
  processed and analysed by the Knight Lab at University of California,
  San Diego and you will be provided with a list of the major groups of
  bacteria in your sample and the proportions in which they are found.
  We estimate that this will take around 3 months from the time your
  sample is scanned into our lab (but possibly longer) and once we
  provide you with your results, you will be able to see how your
  bacterial community compares to others in the study. From the diet and
  lifestyle information that you provide, we will also be able to show
  you how your results compare to other people who are within the same
  diet and lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to
  them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you
  have experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your
  bacterial profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information/advice related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah","2,465",of $177k goal,https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes,Hannah's Heroes,47,,U.S. Dollar
"HOW IT ALL STARTED AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS My husband, Poh Teik “Jack” Teoh, age 63, was diagnosed with
    Stage 4 skin cancer in September 2017.  The cancer has spread to his
    spine and ribs and has severely weakened his body in ways that are
    distressing and heart-breaking for us both. The cancer started out as a very small growth on Jack’s right
    ear. It was initially diagnosed as a fungus infection and treated
    successfully with anti-fungal medication in the USA in the spring of
    2015.  In November of 2015, with great health and high expectations,
    we decided to follow our ultimate dream and set-up an import/export
    business in Penang, Malaysia; my husband’s birthplace. In Malaysia, the growth on Jack’s ear
    gradually came back so we sought medical help. The first doctor
    diagnosed the growth as cancerous. He recommended amputating the
    whole ear and scraping off the brain tissue surrounding the ear
    followed by plastic surgery to make a new ear.  We immediately
    sought a second opinion as the growth was very small. To us and many
    others this surgical solution was too severe and Jack’s overall
    health was excellent. The second doctor recommended a series of
    stronger medications including chemo pills. We followed this
    treatment and managed to keep the growth under control. We expected
    the growth would vanish just as it did in the USA In early 2017 my husband started to
    feel weak off and on with intermittent and sometimes indescribable
    pain. Jack managed to control the pain with prescribed medication
    and his own sheer will. We continued to work very hard at full speed
    to launch our import business, putting in our best effort with full
    enthusiasm to make our dreams come true.  Then in August, Jack
    suddenly became extremely weak, he lost his appetite completely and
    the growth started to spread at an alarming rate.   That’s when I
    admitted Jack into Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital here in Penang,
    Malaysia; an excellent hospital with a phenomenal medical staff. I
    moved into Jack’s hospital room the day he was admitted and have not
    left his side since. For the full medical diagnosis see the letter written by
      Jack’s doctor (Dr. Ho) below: THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF THE COME-BACK KID – THE FIRST 2
      MONTHS AT MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Due to the excellent care at Mount Miriam Cancer
    Hospital, in addition to Jack’s inimitable strength and fighting
    spirit, Jack has been able to consistently beat all odds and triumph
    over some very serious health issues. In early September, a few days
    after his first chemo infusion, he suffered a heart attack.
    Amazingly, Jack recovered and prevailed with willingness and
    strength. Just three weeks after his heart attack, Jack decided to
    continue the chemo (in a more gentler form) to resume his fight
    against his cancer. Due to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength since August,
    Jack no longer has the strength to stand up on his own. He can only
    walk a short distance in our hospital room with a walker and the
    assistance of a therapist.  My husband is bound to the bed most of
    the time. He barely has enough strength to practice learning how to
    walk again.  But despite the severity of Jack’s condition, and the
    utter frustration he endures, he never fails to inspire others, make
    the doctors and nurses smile as they admire his remarkable strength
    and positivity. After the 4th chemo infusion on October 25th, Jack developed
    an infection that hit him fast and fierce. His oxygen levels dropped
    dramatically and he had extreme difficulty breathing. He was headed
    for the Intensive Care Unit at another hospital but thankfully the
    medical staff at Mount Miriam got the infection under control
    quickly and stabilized Jack beautifully.  Jack took a brief break
    from the chemo and agreed to resume the treatments on November 10th.
    As Jack said: “there is more positive than negative” and he chooses
    to continue what’s working for him and face every battle head-on. Dr. Ho & Jack Medical Attention ELLEN & JACK: MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER Born in the USA, I grew up Mountain
    Lakes, New Jersey and my husband Jack is from Malaysia.  We met in
    New Jersey in 2003 when Jack was living and working in New York. 
    From the very first day I met Jack he was always robust and full of
    life. He woke up every morning like it was Christmas, just like a
    child.  Jack is like a magnet, he’s irresistible, pulling people in
    with his charisma and zany sense of humour.  But what stole my heart
    is his heart. I have never met a person as self-less as my husband.
    He is someone I can trust with all my heart to do the right thing
    for anyone in any situation. Jack is a leader with a big heart; some
    would say a true warrior.  It’s absolutely heart-wrenching for me to
    see my husband suffer and become so weak and frail in such a short
    period of time.  He has spent a lifetime generously helping others
    and now is in great need himself.  I ask you to please help me help
    my husband, so he can beat this cancer and we can continue our lives
    as one.  This journey of recovery and healing will take time, but we
    both have a deep, enduring faith that we will prevail with the
    continuation of the excellent medical care at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital. Jack and me 2005 HELP NEEDED WITH MEDICAL EXPENSES Monthly Medical Expenses at Mount
    Miriam Cancer Hospital Averages $7205.50 USD Due to the onset of Jack’s illness,
    the launching of our business was cut short, so we are not
    generating any income.  Due to my husband’s fragile and
    unpredictable condition, I am with him around the clock to make sure
    his special and urgent needs are met. Jack is not in an intensive
    care unit, but still requires my watchful presence so if/when and
    emergency arises he gets immediate medical attention.  Sometimes
    it's a matter of seconds that will determine someone's fate as it
    was when I alerted the medical staff of his extraordinary high fever
    and severe difficulty in breathing. With neither one of us working,
    continuing to pay for Jack’s medical expenses and our basic but
    essential living expenses is an impossibility without the help of
    others. Not until Jack is stable enough for me to leave his side can
    I resume the full-time re-launch of our import business. Not having medical insurance, we have
    received some financial help from the hospital’s social welfare
    department. However, it’s not enough and I am not sure if it will
    continue. Witnessing my husband go through periods of anguish and
    taking care of him can be very stressful and exhausting. With your
    kind consideration and help, our financial stress can be alleviated.
    Your generosity would allow me to brave this journey with less
    pressure and more strength to support my husband with his medical
    and personal needs. Your financial help, and the spreading of my
    campaign on your social network, will be forever appreciated because
    I simply cannot do this alone.  Thank you ever so much. It’s very difficult to determine when
    Jack will be discharged and continue his treatments as an
    out-patient either from home or a step-down facility.  Just when it
    looks like a discharge is nearing, he has another set-back that
    requires intensive hospital care.  With more chemo on the way, I
    just don’t know what to expect and how his body will respond. We
    take it week by week, day by day. Jack started a 12-week course of chemo on September 29th.
    After he finished his 4th infusion on October 20th he had a set-back
    due to a serious infection but resumed his infusions on November
    10th. He recently finished his 6th chemo but is taking a break to
    garner some strength and a better appetite before he does the 7th
    chemo.  After this 12-week course is finished, there will be a
    reassessment and break before the next chemo course starts.  Then,
    after 6 months of chemo infusions there will be another reassessment
    to determine the next phase of treatment, which may include radiation. At this point in time, it’s impossible to determine our
    medical and living expenses after discharge. It all depends on how
    stable and self-sufficient Jack is at that time. I do know that it
    will take some time, months, for him to regain the strength
    necessary to walk on his own again.  If Jack is not re-admitted into
    the hospital, we will be looking at the following expenses. This is the best approximation I can give at this time: MEDICAL EXPENSES AFTER DISCHARGE FROM MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Live-in, Step-down Facility with Medical Care and Physical
    Therapy:   $1,125.00 USD per month (a step-down facility if
  necessary, or Jack can do his out-patient from home ) Basic Medical Supplies Needed at Home:  $436.00 USD
  min (wheelchair, walker, commode, air cushion mattress) Monthly Physical Therapy & Visiting Nurse at Home: 
    $705.00 USD Monthly Out-Patient Expenses at Mount Miriam Hospital: approximate range of $1,143.00 to $2,755.00
  USD (doctor appointments, blood tests, chemo infusions,
  blood transfusions, ear dressings, medications) 10 Course Treatment of Radiation:  $2,000 USD When a donation is made, the money will be accepted by PayPal
    and then deposited into my USA bank checking account.  With my USA
    checking account debit card, I can pay for Jack’s medical expenses
    here at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.  From my Malaysian bank, I can
    also withdraw cash (in the form of Malaysian Ringgits) from my USA
    checking account and this will help me with our essential living
    expenses (apartment rent, utilities, food and transportation). The following fees are deducted from each donation (USA &
    Canada): Fundrazr : 5% PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 Total
    deducted from each donation:  7.9% + $0.30 International fees:  Fundrazr 5%  &  PayPal 4.3% to 4.5% + $0.30 Calling on all Angels with a giving
    heart. Due to my desperate situation, this is the first time I have
    ever done a fundraiser.  As my social network is small, I would
    greatly appreciate your help in sharing my campaign.  I just do not
    know what lies ahead in medical expenses, it’s very hard to predict.
    The hospital has been understanding of my financial situation but
    does expect a significant payment every 2 to 3 weeks. I greatly appreciate your kind consideration in supporting me
    & donating to the best of your ability in this critical
    situation.  Thank you all so very much. With Great Appreciation & Love, Ellen","13,205",of $125k goal,https://fundrazr.com/HelpEllenSupportJack,Bridge Over Troubled Water for Jack,83,,U.S. Dollar

  being transferred there from Toronto General Hospital, and is at risk
  for organ damage in his lungs and heart, his kidneys are functioning
  at 0% capacity, and his lower limbs are at risk for amputation. He is
  currently on daily dialysis, and has not recovered most of his

  He loves teaching younger children and especially loves sports, namely
  soccer, where he volunteered his time to coach 4 teams, ranging from
  ages 12 -16. He is also in the process of completing his
  professional refereeing licenses. Paul recently purchased his first home, a condo close to home, where

"Thank you for taking the time to visit this page in honor of Jake. 
  The Conde family is extremely grateful for each and every one of you.
    The saying "" It takes a village"" is definitely true in
  this situation. How does a family properly thank someone for the
  things that they have done to help out during difficult times?  You
  need to know how much all the prior well wishes, positive thoughts,
  prayers, donations, helping with meals, helping out with Lucas, gifts
  for Jake, time spent together, and friendship has meant to the Conde
  family - THANK YOU! Here we go again... Where do I even begin?  Honestly, it's really
  difficult to gather thoughts, considering so much has gone on the past
  77 weeks.  As most of you know, Jake was diagnosed with Ewing's
  Sarcoma in his left femur bone in April of 2015, when he was 9 years
  old. To keep it short, it was a very long year with many nights in the
  hospital, multiple biopsies, surgeries, chemo, lab/diagnostic testing,
  physical therapy etc.  It was a nightmare, but they got through it -
  or so they thought.  Shortly after his year long cancer treatment
  ended, Jake started having pain in his shoulder and losing weight, so
  they took him in for testing.  Then came the devastating news, which
  was even worse than the first time around.  Not only was his cancer
  back, they were told that Jake had 6 metastatic tumors. Cancer sucks!
  Sarcoma sucks! Many of you have emailed or left messages for Steph, Roger, and
  myself asking what you can do to help. First and foremost, for those
  of you who pray, please keep Jake in your daily prayers.  Jake has a
  birthday coming up, he turns 11 on October 22nd.  If you would like to
  send him a card or write him a note, you can mail it directly to his
  home, or contact me (my number is below) for more information. For
  those of you who would like to make a small donation, that would be
  great too. I know that they are spending thousands of dollars out of
  pocket each month. Currently Jake has had five in-patient chemo treatments (each 5 days
  long), and goes back in on Monday 10/17 for his sixth treatment.  A
  recent scan showed only 2 of his 6 tumors as active - this is good
  news!  The current plan is to give Jake 18 months of chemo - that's
  the bad news!  The chemo is taking a toll on him, the drugs are very
  hard on your body, it's been tough! In addition to chemo, the Conde family strongly believes in an
  alternative and holistic approach this time around; they believe
  that the chemo alone will not cure their son.  Jake is eating all
  organic and non-gmo foods, using essential oils, cannabis oil,
  juicing, drinking alkaline water & special teas, taking
  supplements... You name it, they're doing it! What the Conde family is going through is impossible to comprehend. 
  We've watched Jake go from being such a happy, funny, spirited
  child who was so full of life, to fighting for his life. What are the
  days during chemo and just after chemo like for them now?  At times
  Jake is screaming/crying in pain, has anxiety/fear of upcoming
  procedures/testing, vomits throughout the day, spends most of the day
  on the couch or in bed with no energy, is up sick most of the night,
  feels depressed, angry, and lonely at times. It stinks! It's really
  tough to see him/them go through this!  Roger and Steph are up around
  the clock caring for Jake, it's 24/7!  But, they continue to stay
  strong, believe in miracles, and have hope!  Losing is not an option! During Jake's first year of treatment Jake watched a lot of Adam
  Sandler movies in the hospital, Stephanie and Roger expressed how
  those movies helped them get through the awful hospital stays. 
  Laughter soothes the soul!  If you have any really good funny movie
  suggestions that are appropriate for an 11 year old, please make suggestions. The best therapy for Jake and family right now is for them to get out
  of the house (when Jake is feeling well), or to have company; they
  love to be around friends and family every chance they get. Even if
  it's for a short time.  Don't be afraid to reach out! We are all thankful for every minute, hour or glimpse of happiness
  that Jake feels. When he smiles, we all smile! Thank you for your concern and continued support.

    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with

"Sebastian Major is 16 years old. He is a loving, caring young man who
  enjoys reading, video games, hanging out with his friends, and, like
  most kids, fighting with his brother and sister. In October 2011, Sebastian was diagnosed with Stage IV
  Neuroblastoma, a cancer that starts in the nerve cells, and is rarely
  found in children over the age of 4. He is nearing the end of a long,
  difficult road. His initial treatments were at St. Louis
    Childrens. He has endured 6 rounds of high-dosage chemotherapy, a
    bone marrow transplant, 18 bone marrow biopsies, a major surgery to
    remove a large mass from his abdomen, and countless tests and scans.
    He had 2 rounds of mibg radiation therapy in Cincinnati, OH, and 40
    rounds of palliative radiation at Carle Hospital in Champaign, IL.
    He also received treatment at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago,
    where he had a team of oncologists who specialize in Neuroblastoma.
    We were unable to improve his disease. In July 2014, following
    complications due to chemo, Sebastian decided to stop treatment.
    He's been on hospice care ever since then.","4,560",,https://fundrazr.com/BastianHope,Hope For Sebastian,,,

"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

  2 when I was 16 years old with hearing and vision damaged. It causes
  tumours to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumours whenever needed to preserve my life. In the end of 2017, I need to undergo surgery again to remove
  multiple large tumours called schwannoma from both my arms. They have
  made my fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I lose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared
  of well in the ward. My vision became damaged as a result, I have had
  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to
  stay productive, while my mother started having to prepare my daily

"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in

  operation. This time, to remove the plate and 8 screws that had gotten
  infected. The doctors later found that my bone had started getting

"HOW IT ALL STARTED AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS My husband, Poh Teik “Jack” Teoh, age 63, was diagnosed with
    Stage 4 skin cancer in September 2017.  The cancer has spread to his
    spine and ribs and has severely weakened his body in ways that are
    distressing and heart-breaking for us both. The cancer started out as a very small growth on Jack’s right
    ear. It was initially diagnosed as a fungus infection and treated
    successfully with anti-fungal medication in the USA in the spring of
    2015.  In November of 2015, with great health and high expectations,
    we decided to follow our ultimate dream and set-up an import/export
    business in Penang, Malaysia; my husband’s birthplace. In Malaysia, the growth on Jack’s ear
    gradually came back so we sought medical help. The first doctor
    diagnosed the growth as cancerous. He recommended amputating the
    whole ear and scraping off the brain tissue surrounding the ear
    followed by plastic surgery to make a new ear.  We immediately
    sought a second opinion as the growth was very small. To us and many
    others this surgical solution was too severe and Jack’s overall
    health was excellent. The second doctor recommended a series of
    stronger medications including chemo pills. We followed this
    treatment and managed to keep the growth under control. We expected
    the growth would vanish just as it did in the USA In early 2017 my husband started to
    feel weak off and on with intermittent and sometimes indescribable
    pain. Jack managed to control the pain with prescribed medication
    and his own sheer will. We continued to work very hard at full speed
    to launch our import business, putting in our best effort with full
    enthusiasm to make our dreams come true.  Then in August, Jack
    suddenly became extremely weak, he lost his appetite completely and
    the growth started to spread at an alarming rate.   That’s when I
    admitted Jack into Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital here in Penang,
    Malaysia; an excellent hospital with a phenomenal medical staff. I
    moved into Jack’s hospital room the day he was admitted and have not
    left his side since. For the full medical diagnosis see the letter written by
      Jack’s doctor (Dr. Ho) below: THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF THE COME-BACK KID – THE FIRST 2
      MONTHS AT MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Due to the excellent care at Mount Miriam Cancer
    Hospital, in addition to Jack’s inimitable strength and fighting
    spirit, Jack has been able to consistently beat all odds and triumph
    over some very serious health issues. In early September, a few days
    after his first chemo infusion, he suffered a heart attack.
    Amazingly, Jack recovered and prevailed with willingness and
    strength. Just three weeks after his heart attack, Jack decided to
    continue the chemo (in a more gentler form) to resume his fight
    against his cancer. Due to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength since August,
    Jack no longer has the strength to stand up on his own. He can only
    walk a short distance in our hospital room with a walker and the
    assistance of a therapist.  My husband is bound to the bed most of
    the time. He barely has enough strength to practice learning how to
    walk again.  But despite the severity of Jack’s condition, and the
    utter frustration he endures, he never fails to inspire others, make
    the doctors and nurses smile as they admire his remarkable strength
    and positivity. After the 4th chemo infusion on October 25th, Jack developed
    an infection that hit him fast and fierce. His oxygen levels dropped
    dramatically and he had extreme difficulty breathing. He was headed
    for the Intensive Care Unit at another hospital but thankfully the
    medical staff at Mount Miriam got the infection under control
    quickly and stabilized Jack beautifully.  Jack took a brief break
    from the chemo and agreed to resume the treatments on November 10th.
    As Jack said: “there is more positive than negative” and he chooses
    to continue what’s working for him and face every battle head-on. Dr. Ho & Jack Medical Attention ELLEN & JACK: MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER Born in the USA, I grew up Mountain
    Lakes, New Jersey and my husband Jack is from Malaysia.  We met in
    New Jersey in 2003 when Jack was living and working in New York. 
    From the very first day I met Jack he was always robust and full of
    life. He woke up every morning like it was Christmas, just like a
    child.  Jack is like a magnet, he’s irresistible, pulling people in
    with his charisma and zany sense of humour.  But what stole my heart
    is his heart. I have never met a person as self-less as my husband.
    He is someone I can trust with all my heart to do the right thing
    for anyone in any situation. Jack is a leader with a big heart; some
    would say a true warrior.  It’s absolutely heart-wrenching for me to
    see my husband suffer and become so weak and frail in such a short
    period of time.  He has spent a lifetime generously helping others
    and now is in great need himself.  I ask you to please help me help
    my husband, so he can beat this cancer and we can continue our lives
    as one.  This journey of recovery and healing will take time, but we
    both have a deep, enduring faith that we will prevail with the
    continuation of the excellent medical care at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital. Jack and me 2005 HELP NEEDED WITH MEDICAL EXPENSES Monthly Medical Expenses at Mount
    Miriam Cancer Hospital Averages $7205.50 USD Due to the onset of Jack’s illness,
    the launching of our business was cut short, so we are not
    generating any income.  Due to my husband’s fragile and
    unpredictable condition, I am with him around the clock to make sure
    his special and urgent needs are met. Jack is not in an intensive
    care unit, but still requires my watchful presence so if/when and
    emergency arises he gets immediate medical attention.  Sometimes
    it's a matter of seconds that will determine someone's fate as it
    was when I alerted the medical staff of his extraordinary high fever
    and severe difficulty in breathing. With neither one of us working,
    continuing to pay for Jack’s medical expenses and our basic but
    essential living expenses is an impossibility without the help of
    others. Not until Jack is stable enough for me to leave his side can
    I resume the full-time re-launch of our import business. Not having medical insurance, we have
    received some financial help from the hospital’s social welfare
    department. However, it’s not enough and I am not sure if it will
    continue. Witnessing my husband go through periods of anguish and
    taking care of him can be very stressful and exhausting. With your
    kind consideration and help, our financial stress can be alleviated.
    Your generosity would allow me to brave this journey with less
    pressure and more strength to support my husband with his medical
    and personal needs. Your financial help, and the spreading of my
    campaign on your social network, will be forever appreciated because
    I simply cannot do this alone.  Thank you ever so much. It’s very difficult to determine when
    Jack will be discharged and continue his treatments as an
    out-patient either from home or a step-down facility.  Just when it
    looks like a discharge is nearing, he has another set-back that
    requires intensive hospital care.  With more chemo on the way, I
    just don’t know what to expect and how his body will respond. We
    take it week by week, day by day. Jack started a 12-week course of chemo on September 29th.
    After he finished his 4th infusion on October 20th he had a set-back
    due to a serious infection but resumed his infusions on November
    10th. He recently finished his 6th chemo but is taking a break to
    garner some strength and a better appetite before he does the 7th
    chemo.  After this 12-week course is finished, there will be a
    reassessment and break before the next chemo course starts.  Then,
    after 6 months of chemo infusions there will be another reassessment
    to determine the next phase of treatment, which may include radiation. At this point in time, it’s impossible to determine our
    medical and living expenses after discharge. It all depends on how
    stable and self-sufficient Jack is at that time. I do know that it
    will take some time, months, for him to regain the strength
    necessary to walk on his own again.  If Jack is not re-admitted into
    the hospital, we will be looking at the following expenses. This is the best approximation I can give at this time: MEDICAL EXPENSES AFTER DISCHARGE FROM MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Live-in, Step-down Facility with Medical Care and Physical
    Therapy:   $1,125.00 USD per month (a step-down facility if
  necessary, or Jack can do his out-patient from home ) Basic Medical Supplies Needed at Home:  $436.00 USD
  min (wheelchair, walker, commode, air cushion mattress) Monthly Physical Therapy & Visiting Nurse at Home: 
    $705.00 USD Monthly Out-Patient Expenses at Mount Miriam Hospital: approximate range of $1,143.00 to $2,755.00
  USD (doctor appointments, blood tests, chemo infusions,
  blood transfusions, ear dressings, medications) 10 Course Treatment of Radiation:  $2,000 USD When a donation is made, the money will be accepted by PayPal
    and then deposited into my USA bank checking account.  With my USA
    checking account debit card, I can pay for Jack’s medical expenses
    here at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.  From my Malaysian bank, I can
    also withdraw cash (in the form of Malaysian Ringgits) from my USA
    checking account and this will help me with our essential living
    expenses (apartment rent, utilities, food and transportation). The following fees are deducted from each donation (USA &
    Canada): Fundrazr : 5% PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 Total
    deducted from each donation:  7.9% + $0.30 International fees:  Fundrazr 5%  &  PayPal 4.3% to 4.5% + $0.30 Calling on all Angels with a giving
    heart. Due to my desperate situation, this is the first time I have
    ever done a fundraiser.  As my social network is small, I would
    greatly appreciate your help in sharing my campaign.  I just do not
    know what lies ahead in medical expenses, it’s very hard to predict.
    The hospital has been understanding of my financial situation but
    does expect a significant payment every 2 to 3 weeks. I greatly appreciate your kind consideration in supporting me
    & donating to the best of your ability in this critical
    situation.  Thank you all so very much. With Great Appreciation & Love, Ellen","13,205",of $125k goal,https://fundrazr.com/HelpEllenSupportJack,Bridge Over Troubled Water for Jack,83,,U.S. Dollar

"Hello World..My name is Shannon.
      I have two older brothers; Jon and Chris. Both of them are
      colorblind. Over the years we have all drifted in and out of
      touch, but our family is a large one and we love getting together,
      so everyone sticks around pretty well. When someone doesn't show
      up to a gathering, we miss them! Their absence from our lives is
      noted. This is just one way that I can think of to let at least
      two of those family members know that they mean something to us
      and that we think of them, even when they're not around as much. I found Enchroma a couple of
      years ago. I don't know how I did, if it was an add, or through a
      friend or acquaintance.. I truly can't remember, but somehow I
      did. I had both of my brothers take the test online and they both
      were evaluated as moderate deutans. No surprise there, they were
      both diagnosed as children.. Funny story there, apparently my
      parents didn't know both of their boys were color blind, but one
      had shown signs. When the test was being administered to my oldest
      brother Chris, my other brother Jon was looking over his shoulder.
      They asked what number Chris saw - he replied that he didn't see
      any number. Jon thought they were messing with him, because he
      piped up ""What numbers!?"" I have been wanting to get them Enchroma glasses for a
        while now, but 1. They're expensive and I don't personally make
        a ton of money. 2. I was nervous about how they would react.
        Would they be excited? What if they got upset? Why wouldn't they
        be excited!? It's one thing to read about what these glasses can
        do, but to experience it? ...There's no way to compare it,
        right? So I have to take the plunge! I want  to do this for
        them, because what are sisters for? They are for love and
        support and sharing . I want to share with them
        the colors they have never been able to experience. But I need help. I would love to be able to get them each
        a pair of these glasses, because while I live in the Austin TX
        area, one brother lives in Houston, and the other in South
        Dakota! Ugh! Distance! If I can get enough money raised to pay for one of the two
        pairs +, I think I would be able to take the hit and pay for the
        rest of the second pair myself. Otherwise they'll have to share! Any help is appreciated. Sometimes people don't realize
        how far just a couple dollars can go, and in this case, it's to
        help people see a world of color. (P.S. I'm totally making them

"Hey Everyone! For those of you who don't know, my 5 year old son Victor is
  Protan color blind. What does that mean? To break it down, he can see some colors but not most. For example, super bright shades
  of color he can usually pick up on so long as the lighting in the room
  or outside is good. Other shades of color (especially darker colors)
  all begin to look the same. Some examples? I asked my son to
  tell me what colors the following texts are. These are the colors and
  his responses: What color is this? Orange! So what color does this look like to him? Green! How about this color? What
            does he see? Purple! What color does he see here? Brown He knows that he is color
                blind but doesn't really understand it. How do you explain to
              someone that the color they see isn't really the color
              they see? Being color blind has
                caused interference with his lessons and daily play. He does the best he can
                despite being color blind and reassures me when he
                sees the look on my face. The one I get when I'm too heartbroken to let him
                know he got a color wrong. Like the day we drove by an
                orange excavator. He loves excavators and gleefully
                pointed it out. Only, he called it blue. I asked him to
                repeat what he had said. He hesitantly told
                me...""blue?""... I tried to put on my most
                cheerful voice and tell him he was right, that it was a
                beautiful blue excavator. But he knew already that he
                had gotten it wrong. I have a terrible poker face. He
                smiled and told me that it was ok because I was going to
                buy him super hero glasses so that he could see colors.
                I cheerfully agreed with him hoping he didn't hear my
                voice crack from the strain of trying not to cry. My pain that day wasn't from my son being color
                blind. My pain was from the promise echoed from my son.
                That Mommy will buy him ""super hero glasses""
                so that he can see colors. I made him that promise the
                day we found out he was color blind. And I have worked
                so hard ever since that day to make good on my promise
                to my son. Wouldn't you know that life keeps getting in
                the way? I'm sure everyone who reads this will
                understand what I mean by that. Every single time my
                husband and I start gathering up enough spare money to
                buy our son his Enchroma glasses something happens to
                set us back financially. Car dying, expensive dental
                care, new roof, etc, etc. The list continues as life
                continues. It's beyond frustrating to begin with for
                anyone. But to know that every time something happens it
                is another month (and another, and another, and
                another...) that I can't make good on my promise to my
                son... well that, as I'm sure you already know if you
                are a parent, is gut wrenching. To the point where I'm
                now doing something I never thought I'd do...I'm asking
                for help. I've never met anyone who likes asking
                for help including myself. Sure I'll ask for help
                reaching something too high up or perhaps an extra hand
                to help carry in the groceries. But humbling myself to
                ask for help on a financial level is something I try to
                avoid doing at all costs. However, for my son, I will. So if you are reading this, and if you have any
                capacity and desire to help, I am asking you for it. I
                do not ask lightly. I really doubt I'll ever be able to
                pay you back which is why it makes this so hard for me.
                I don't mind asking for something I can repay. It's
                having to ask people for nothing more than their sheer
                kindheartedness and generosity that humbles me because
                it leaves me feeling as vulnerable as a sinner asking
                The Lord for forgiveness. I feel unworthy of it. I
                question if I even have such a right to ask for it. Yet,
                out of hope, I ask anyway. If you are wondering,
                the color blind gene is carried from the mother's side.
                My father is also Protan color blind. I want desperately
                to buy him glasses too. He told me to worry about my son
                first and not him. If (for some miracle) this campaign
                actually goes far enough to get money for two glasses,
                you bet I'm getting them for my Dad. I want him to see
                the true colors of a sunset after 70 years of not really
                knowing what it is he's been seeing all this time. I'm already asking for so much...but if you can
                help either financially or by spreading the word by
                sharing this campaign for me I will be truly grateful
                beyond expression of words. My deepest gratitude

"My name is Stefani, better known as ""Delia Melody,"" from my
  YouTube channel on trans rights, and writing for the Huffington Post's
  Queer Voices column. Earlier this year following evidence of being
  stalked, I was raped, and survived an attempt to drug me and leave me
  in a trap-house by certain individuals, some of whom have personally
  *claimed* connection to my ex-wife's family. For the past 10 months, this has left me mentally shattered,
  without support from many of my previous network who have withdrawn
  from me on account of respectability politics and rumors, and moving
  from place to place all over the country in an attempt to find any
  sense of stability and rebuild my life, which has made finding
  additional work (which was previously unnecessary), incredibly
  difficult when coupled with the obstacles my transness and
  neurodivergeance (I suffer from clinically diagnosed PTSD, and
  Adjustment Disorder, which I am also currently unable to afford
  treament for), already place on me. I am raising these funds to afford my medically necessary, and
  prescribed Hormone Replacement Therapy, consisting of Finasteride and
  Spironolactone for Testosterone blocking, and Estrogen and
  Progesterone, and prescribed by my endocrinologist and Planned
  Parenthood on the basis of my biological necessity for this treatment
  as an intersex transgender woman. Being on these hormones has a
  positive effect on my mental stability, and physical wellbeing. Having
  to go without them is inadvised, and results in documented mental
  instability, depression, and uncontrollable anger, and physical
  deterioration, including muscular atrophy, rapid weight loss on
  account of an inability to maintain healthy body fat, chronic
  diarrhea, and immune system compromise. If you can help at all, I'm asking that you please do. I don't
  like having to crowdfund for this need, it's a huge blow to the pride
  I take in my work, and myself, but I also recognize that in a
  situation like this, it is important to be able to recognize when I
  *must* swallow my pride and seek the help I need. I know that my
  friends and family care about my wellbeing, and recognize that this is
  not a matter of choice, or comfort, but an unfortunate medical need on

"OUR GAME PLAN We are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from
    the bottom of our hearts. Your actions may make a huge difference to
    Mom’s life and to all those who care about her and who don’t want to
    lose her.","1,650",of $20k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41FO1c,PLEASE HELP SAVE MY MOM,14,,Canadian Dollar
"Braden needs a heart transplant and has other disabilities. Funds are
  being raised to improve his quality of life so he can live as normally
  as possible and have access to everything he needs to improve
  everyday. Here is his story: Braden was born December 7th, 2009. He was diagnosed in utero with
  Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA). After he was born, things seemed to
  improve and we were sent home from the birthing hospital. Two days
  later, December 14th, 2009, we saw our pediatrician for a routine
  check-up. Dr. Setia discovered Braden had no palpable pulses in his
  legs and we were immediately sent to Pediatric Cardiology Services,
  the office of Dr. Videlefsky’s office. Once arriving there, an
  Echocardiogram and EKG were performed. Dr. V confirmed our fears.
  Braden was then transferred to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at
  Egleston. We handed over our perfect, beautiful baby boy to the
  Cardiac Intensive Care Unit staff. A few hours later, we were allowed
  back into the CICU to see him. He looked so pitiful. He was hooked up
  to so many machines and had IVs and oxygen. It was absolutely unreal
  to see him that way. We were told the Coarctation of the Aorta was
  present and they would be performing surgery. On December 16th, at 9 days old, Braden had his first heart
  surgery. The CoA was repaired. The surgeon also discovered Braden had
  a Hypoplastic Aortic Arch. They did a left subclavian artery flap to
  repair it. This means Braden has no artery in his left arm, they told
  us his body would compensate for the loss. He struggled post-op and
  remained on the ventilator longer than we expected. Once it was
  removed, he drastically declined and they had to intubate him again.
  He slowly began to recover again and finally made it to the step down unit. Finally, on December 23rd, we were able to take our precious
  baby home, just in time for Christmas. He was too weak to suck a
  bottle so he came home with a Nasogastric tube for the majority of his feedings. Unfortunately, on January 4th, Braden began to drastically
  decline and we rushed him into CHOA. Pressures in Braden’s lungs had
  changed and it revealed several VSDs in his heart also known as Swiss
  Cheese VSDs. He underwent his second heart surgery on January 12th,
  2010. The surgeon placed a Pulmonary Artery band to help slow the
  blood flow to his lungs. After struggling yet again to come off the
  ventilator, and needing to be re-intubated, we finally returned home
  on January 19th. Sadly, our stay at home was short lived. Something
  was not right with Braden. We made several trips into the ER for
  respiratory distress. Braden was once again readmitted to the
  hospital. After staying for a week, it was discovered that Braden was
  micro-aspirating. He was aspirating bits of everything he ate, along
  with reflux coming up from his stomach. On March 11th, 2010, Braden underwent his 3rd surgery. He had a
  Nissen Fundoplication and a G-tube inserted. The Nissen Funoplicaton
  wraps the top of the stomach around the bottom of the esophagus to
  tighten things up so nothing can come up from the stomach. He finally
  came home, but was on oxygen due to issues with his pulse ox after all
  the damage that was caused to his lungs. He remained on oxygen for 9
  months. We continued to follow up with our cardiologist, pulmonologist
  and Gastroenterologist. Braden had several hospital admissions from
  his discharge in March until July. In July 2010, Braden underwent a
  heart cath to check things over. We were very blessed to have been
  able to avoid the hospital from August-November .Braden finally was
  strong enough and was removed from Oxygen in November. In December 2010, Braden had another heart cath. It revealed
  that the Pulmonary Artery Band was ready to be removed. On January
  11th, 2011, Braden underwent his 3rd heart surgery and 4th overall
  surgery. The Pulmonary Artery band was removed, an ASD was closed and
  approximately 6 VSDs were closed as well. There was some damage done
  to his heart in the form of dilation and thickening of the heart
  muscles. It was thought to be related to the Pulmonary Artery banding
  and we were optimistic it would slowly improve as time went on. We
  continued to follow up with our doctors, mainly Cardiology. In April
  2012, a heart cath was done. It showed signs of (RCM) Restrictive
  Cardiomyopathy but no official diagnosis was made. We didn’t get
  discouraged and continued following up with the cardiologist. In July, 2012, Dr. Videlefsky recommended we make a visit to
  Dr. Mahle, Egleston’s Transplant doctor. Our lives changed in a way
  they had never changed before. Dr. Mahle not only confirmed the
  diagnosis of RCM, but told us our only option for Braden would be
  transplant. As long as Braden remains stable, we can avoid the
  transplant list but at any time, he could decline. We aren't promised
  tomorrow so we live today! We live each day holding our breath but try to enjoy every
  moment we can with him. We ask for prayers to keep our son stable as
  long as possible. The doctors are projecting that Braden will be
  listed and possibly transplanted within three years from when he was
  diagnosed. We have faith we can go much longer than that, but again,
  no one knows how long we have. Along with the heart defects, Braden carries the clinical
  diagnosis of Noonan Syndrome. This was a spontaneous mutation within
  the genes. He also has hypotonia, reflux, has a feeding tube in his
  tummy, moderate speech delays, oral aversion and moderate sensory
  integration. If you ask him, he will tell you ""I get a new
  heart"" We try our best to help him understand so he isn't fearful
  during appointments and procedures.",115,of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/dkI0b,Help Braden fight RCM,5,,U.S. Dollar

  enable hundreds of empoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. We support Escuela Proyecto La Esperanza (The
  School of Hope) in Jocotenango, Guatemala because of their ideals and
  accomplishments. In order to improve a population you need empowerment
  and independence. The proven form has been education. This school provides that. Furthermore they understand that
  supporting a child whom faces countless socioeconomic and
  psychological barriers requires a holistic approach. What these
  children face on a near daily basis makes all of our life obstacles
  seem pity. The staff and volunteers here are committed. It's no secret that we
  hold teachers and social workers in the highest regard. The people
  here are an outstanding example of why we feel this way. They
  genuinely care and love the community in which they are improving.
  They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long term and sustainable
  commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless these socioeconomic
  issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any and all

"Their Story Hello Everyone, My name is Carrie and I have the
      pleasure of being a daughter and an Aunt to wonderful people. My
      father is in his 60s and has spent his entire life not being able
      to see all the colors in the rainbow. He has had carpenter jobs
      and has worked with cars, but has always had limitations. My
      father's art is truly amazing, but there is never colors. I want
      him to be able to add colors to his art and not have limitations.
      My two nephews will also spend a life without all the colors
      unless we can change that. The other day I pointed out a rainbow
      that was in the sky before I realized that they might not see it.
      The rainbow was faint appearing. My nephew must have stared in the
      sky for a good ten minutes trying to see it all. I want to give
      the gift of color vision to my family. Please contribute by
      donating and sharing their story. I hope to raise enough money to
      at least buy adult Enchroma glasses for my father to wear and the
      boys to try on, but it would be awesome if they all could have
      their own pair of glasses. Any amount helps and if you can not

"About John John has been color blind since
    birth. When he was first in school his teacher was concerned because
    he would only use crayon with their color label still attached.
    Later on they found out he was reading the color name. When Curtis,
    John's father, was doing research for his graduate degree, he
    discovered that John was Red-green color blind. People John meets
    these days can't tell he is colorblind because John work's daily to
    strengthen his ability to distinguish colors. To this day he can't
    tell the difference between cantaloupe and honeydew. John's accomplishments John has taken many art classes. He

"Anthony is special. He has a huge heart and he loves his
      friends and family fiercely. I would have to have been totally

      heart to everyone he cares about and even to strangers. He loves
      fully and completely. He believes in the goodness in everyone

      way to see the world he loves so much. I know that it is the holidays and that things are tight for
      everyone. We gratefully don't have a goal that is totally

      would be incredibly appreciated. You all know him. There is a

      mean to me to make this happen. Thank you so much for stopping by here. If you can, please

    guide that the parents could use to explain their kids what
  they were living or were about to live. This is a hard task to do,
  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The
  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,
  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can
  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and
  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids
  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a
  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and
  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.
  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,
  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them
    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could
    too. They became brave and stop cover their eyes because of the
    needles. Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected
    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are
    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the
    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will
  help. Whether you can give or not, please share this widely with
  friends on facebook, twitter, e-mail, or any other social media. The more people who see this project, more kids will be
  happy - developing physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and

"Bob Sobo has been a servant of God and of people throughout his whole
  adult life.  He’s been an Associate Pastor, Senior Pastor and Shelter
  Manager for the San Fernando Valley Rescue Mission where he helped
  many homeless families get back on their feet.  Bob has also had a
  passion for music since boyhood, and he achieved professional status
  as a guitar player and songwriter. Bob has also been a devoted husband and father. He has dedicated his
  life to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom; and yet that pursuit has
  never made him cold or impersonal.  Anyone who has heard Bob laugh
  knows this to be true!  His wry humor and rapier wit have the capacity
  to put any person at ease, as anyone who has spent time with him can
  attest to. Sadly, in December of 2006 when Bob was just 52, he was diagnosed
  with Parkinson’s Disease. Doctors believe that the onset was
  exacerbated by a head injury Bob incurred in a tragic traffic
  collision with a negligent driver in October of that year. This terrible accident occurred as he was heading to a musical gig. 
  Then, like now, he was accompanied by the incomparable Sandy Howell,
  who thankfully incurred only minor injuries.  As a result of that
  accident, the Parkinson’s which would most probably have laid dormant
  for the majority of Bob’s life, surfaced with a vengeance. This disease has exacted a terrible toll on Bob. The first thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  make music with his guitar.   The loss of that light within the world
  has been immeasurable; anyone who has spent any time with Bob knows
  that a guitar in his hands is like a painter with fresh watercolors,
  staring at a beautiful vista… His ability to make that instrument sing
  shaped the majority of my childhood, and it was a shock to everyone
  around him when he couldn’t play anymore. But Bob persevered. The next thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  drive and speak publicly. Everyone was taken by surprise at how Bob’s
  Parkinson’s advanced so quickly, and in such a degenerative manner. 
  Nonetheless, with the help of a few friends, family, and Ms. Sandy
  Howell, Bob was able to continue. Bob persevered. Despite all efforts to the contrary, things have gotten worse for
  Bob.  As a result, he now requires round-the-clock, live-in caregivers
  who assist him in all regular daily functions.  The financial
  assistance that is available to him through normal channels just is
  not at all sufficient to cover his medical and care costs.  He is
  desperate need of additional funding, and he has no means to procure
  it for himself.   He has had some additional help from a kind
  benefactor, but this major portion of his funding is going to come to
  an end, soon. So—the question becomes:  does anyone out there want to help out
  Bob?  He needs your help in order to persevere further.  He is working
  with therapists and doctors, and doing his best throughout all of
  these trials and tribulations.  Will you stand with him?  Can you? He doesn’t want to be in the position where he needs to ask for
  help.  Unfortunately, it’s gotten to the point of him actually needing
  to do so in order to survive.  I know it’s a lot to ask for in this
  day and age; we all have our issues and problems.  Trouble doesn’t
  discriminate, as I’m sure we all know. But Bob needs some help.  Please do what you can.  Let’s help Bob
  persevere further.   On his behalf, I thank each and every one of you

"My name is Ania. I am proud to introduce you a brave, little boy Adaś
  who was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Spinal-muscular-atrophy/pages/introduction.aspx )
   is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss
  of movement. Type 1 is the most severe and in most cases causes severe
  respiratory problems which means that children rarely survive beyond
  two years of age. 1 in 5000 children is born with SMA around the world. Please join this SMA fundraising challenge and help Adaś to continue
  his experimental therapy treatment. Adaś Skrzypek  was born just
  before Christmas with the worst type of SMA, type 1. His parents were
  told that he would not reach his first birthday. The doctors informed
  them that there is no cure for SMA at the moment and all they could do
  was to wait for the worst, while his muscles slowly withered away
  until his respiratory system failed and cause Adaś to suffocate. But,
  despite terrifying diagnosis, Aneta and Tomasz Skrzypek, Adaś’s
  parents didn’t give up. They started a daily rehabilitation regime for
  Adaś and started searching around the world for a cure. Adaś's
  condition deteriorated quickly which meant he was no longer offered
  experimental therapies in Europe. He was now not able to swallow or
  breathe properly and was fitted with a tracheotomy tube. Adaś nearly
  died several times but he is a little fighter and was able to start an
  experimental therapy which his parents had found. They didn’t give up
  after being refused help in Europe and they searched around the world
  finally coming across a new treatment in America. The therapy involves
  an injection every 45 days and oral medications in between. Adaś was
  given the first injection just before he turned 6 months old. And a
  tiny mirracle had happened!! Adaś was able to breathe for 20 minutes
  all by himself for the first time in a very long time. He was also
  able to slightly move his head and suck a dummy. There is a realistic
  chance that the experimental therapy that Adaś is receiving will be
  successfull. But unfortunately the cost of the treatment have exceeded
  his parents financial capabilities. The cost of it is 80000 polish
  zlotych (£15,000) every 45 days, and this sum will increase once the
  doses get stronger. By helping Adaś, we are helping children around the world who have
  been or may be born with incurable SMA. We can make a difference and
  change the world. We are giving hope to all the parents who were told
  that the only thing they could do was to give up and wait for the
  worst. Please help by donating any amount in polish zlotych (PLN) or
  the equivalent in another currency and sharing it on Facebook. We can
  spread the word and be a part of something amazing!! We can save
  children all around the world. * You are most welcome to donate as much as you wish. FundRarz and

  wczesnodziecięcy jest najpoważniejszy. Objawy choroby pojawiają sie
  zaraz po urodzeniu lub do szóstego miesiąca życia. Dziecko rzadko ma
  szansę przeżycia dwóch lat. 1 na 5000 dzieci na świecie rodzi sie z SMA. Adaś Skrzypek jest malutkim chłopczykiem, który urodził się 20
  grudnia 2015 roku w Tarnowie. Adaś jest chory na SMA typ 1. Jego
  rodzice, Aneta i Tomasz Skrzypek, przed Wigilią dowiedzieli się, że
  ich długo wyczekiwany synek może nie doczekać swoich pierwszych
  urodzin. Lekarze nie dawali Adasiowi żadnych szans. Jedyne co Państwo
  Skrzypek mogli zrobić, to poddać się i czekać, aż mięśnie Adasia
  zwiotczeją, a uklad oddechowy przestanie działać i Adaś sie udusi.
  Jednak rodzice Adasia z pełną determinacją podjęli poszukiwania
  eksperymentalnej terapii w Europie, która dałaby szansę Adasiowi.
  Niestety po początkowym zakwalifikowaniu Adasia do jednej z terapii,
  stan chłopca pogorszył sie na tyle, że odmówiono jego leczenia. Adaś
  był kilka razy bliski śmierci, ale jest malutkim wojownikiem i przeżył
  po to, by móc wziąść udział w eksperymentalnej terapii, którą znaleźli
  jego rodzice. Nie poddali sie kiedy odmówiono Adasiowi leczenia w
  Europie i rozpoczęli poszukiwania na szeroką skalę na całym świecie,
  aby wreszcie znaleźć nadzieję w Ameryce. Chłopczykowi zaproponowano
  terapię w trakcie, której co 45 dni dostaje zastrzyk, a w między
  czasie przyjmuje leki doustne. Adaś pierwszy zastrzyk dostał niedługo
  przed swoim 6 miesiącem życia. I stał sie maleńki cud!! Adaś był w
  stanie samodzielnie oddychać przez 20 minut, czego nie mógł robić już
  od długiego czasu. Mógł również lekko poruszać główką i trzymać
  smoczek w buźce. Nie mógł tego robić od wielu tygodni. Jest realna
  szansa, że ta eksperymentalna terapia, której Adaś jest poddawany,
  będzie zakończona sukcesem. Niestety, koszt terapii przerósł
  możliwości finansowe rodziców Adasia. Jej koszt, to 80 tysięcy złotych
  co 45 dni. Może to ulec zwiększeniu, kiedy dozy staną się mocniejsze.
  Pomagając Adasiowi, pomagamy dzieciom na całym świecie, które już są
  lub urodzą się chore na nieuleczalną chorobę rdzeniowego zaniku mięśni
  (SMA). Możemy zmienić ich świat i dać nadzieję rodzicom, którym
  powiedziano, że jedyną rzeczą, którą mogą zrobić, to poddać się i
  czekać na najgorsze. Proszę, pomóżcie Adasiowi wpłacając datki w
  złotówkach lub ich równowartość w innych walutach i udostępniając to
  na Facebooku. Możemy rozpowszechnić informację o Adasiu i być częścią

"Joe was disgnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in 2007 aged 5. We
  had never even heard of it, but once we knew what it meant our hearts
  broke and our world came crashing down around us. You see our
  beautiful, funny, smart child was poorly and he would never get better. Most children with Duchenne lose the ability to walk by the age of
  12, then the rest of their body starts to fail. Before long they can
  no longer raise their arms to feed themsleves or to give you a hug. By
  mid teens they are usually having to use ventilators to
  breathe and using machines to help them cough. Then they get probelms
  with their heart and lungs and they become too weak to fight anymore.
  There is no treatments or cure, so we watch as our child deteriorates
  by the day, knowing there is nothing we can do about it. From day one we have had a battle with the authorities to fund
  equipment, to seek suitable accomodation, to get the right school for
  him, to find funds to get a vehicle that can take his wheelchair. Its
  has been horrendous, soul destroying and incredibly expensive. It was
  made all the worse in Feb 2015, when Joe fell and fractured his spine.
  Life drastucally changed over night as he went from being able to
  walk, in the house, to no longer being able to walk at all and now has
  to rely on us, for everything.... To dress him, to pick things up he
  has dropped, to help him go to the toilet, to scratch an itch, to
  clean him, to bathe him and some times feed him when the fatigue sets
  in and he just doesnt have the strength. He was 12 when this happened. Yet, despite his illness, Joe continues to smile and continues to be
  a rainbow in our thundery skies. He deserves to be able to live in a
   home where he feels comfortable, where he knows he is safe and can
  move freely, where there is the equipment to support his failing body
  with out being afraid his parents are going to drop him because we
  have to lift him. He deserves to be able to get out and about not be
  house bound. He deserves a happy life. He deserves the best life...
  before it's too late. Please, please help to fund for the life changing equipment Joe needs. If you fancy doing a fundraiser for HOPE FOR JOE, please do get in
  touch, that would be amazing! either through this page or anr1976@sky.com. CURRENT FUNDRASING: JANET is running...LOTS for Joe! Lets get behind her! Running

"WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Hey all, so apparently we live in the future and they have these
  awesome glasses that let colorblind people see color! I wanted to get
  these for my dad for Christmas and am fully prepared to pay the $350
  for them, but thought it would be selfish to give such an amazing gift
  myself, when there are so many of you out there who love and admire
  this incredible man.  I think it would be even more of an awesome
  experience to share with him a list of people he has influenced
  throughout his life who wanted to share in giving him this gift.  I
  would love so much to present him with a short note from each of you
  expressing your love and appreciation along with this present as I
  think it would mean so much to him.  For those of you who know him,
  you know what an amazing friend, husband, father, grandfather, bishop,
  coach, youth leader, missionary, home teacher and donut connoisseur
  he's been throughout his life.  Please join me in giving back and
  making this life changing experience more amazing that it could
  possibly be. Any amount will be greatly appreciated and the goal is to
  have them by Christmas. I will be covering any difference so this will
  for sure happen.  Read below for all the technical mumbo jumbo and
  watch a few reaction videos to see how much we really take seeing
  color for granted.  Thank you all in advance and hope to hear from you soon! Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

"As I’m sure many of you know, In the same way that the
      mighty T-Rex couldn’t see an object that was standing still, color
      blind people can’t see colorful objects that aren’t moving either.
      One such person affected by this condition is our very own Brice
      Brosig. Each day Brice struggles to see colorful things that
      aren’t moving. It takes him several minutes to find his car let
      alone get in. Colorblind people like Brice struggle constantly to
      complete the most basic tasks. Finding and Putting on clothes that
      aren’t monochromatic is almost impossible, and forget about
      finding his colorful tooth brush every morning. He just can’t see
      these things. It’s a terrible life to live and I thing we should
      work together to help end his struggle. Edit: I have been told that those who are colorblind can see
      things the same way us normal human beings can, just with some
      colors not registering the same way we see them. I apologize for
      my earlier description of how colorblind people live. This was

"Welcome to our crowdfunding page to help 9 year old Malika.
    She's suffering from a terrible genetic blood disease. We are
    collecting money to pay her family's medical bills and operation to
    remove her spleen as soon as possible. 13 NOV 2017 Major update: We now know the exact name of the
      disease. Thanks to you people who believed in her and donated
      money so she could get her medical research! Thanks to everyone
      who was thinking about the well being of this little girl! About us: Prepare yourself for a trip around the world My name is Bart (from The Netherlands) and I've started this
    project after I've learned from my friend Nadira, that her 9
      year old niece Malika (from Kyrgyzstan) is very sick and
    in desperate need of a cure. Malika has been diagnosed with Spherocytic hemolytic
      anemia ' (severe) , an autoimmune disease . About Malike and her condition Malika (born 16/12/2007) is a nice, beautiful,
    intelligent and very talented young girl , native of
  Kyrgyzstan, Central-Asia. Malika is a purposeful character and every
  day she’s struggling for her life. This girl tries to hold on, but her organs are giving up , she does not have the
  strength to even smile now. Malika was diagnosed with a form of
    Spherocytic hemolytic anemia , or Hereditary
    Spherocytosis . First we collected money to get her to a
    hospital in Moscow to be examined by a specialist because we did not
    know yet what kind of amnemia she suffered from. Now the doctor said: She needs her spleen removed a.s.a.p. It
    will not be sure if she will survive this prodecure. But if she
    doesn't remove the spleen quickly, she will have no future at all.
    So in other words....it is very critical. Watch a short video about Malika and her mother (in Russian). Malika loves to play with dolls and to sew doll clothes. Her
    other hobby is to have fun with play doh, as you can see in the
    video. She has one younger brother and lives together with her
    family (Mrs. Tahmina and Mr. Pope
    Ravshan) in Bishkek. Read a background story on this Kyrgyz website for more info
    (in Russian, use your browser's translator). How much money do we need? Important EU-citizens: Problems with donating
    by Paypal or Creditcard? Contact us and we will provide an IBAN nr. Malika and her family are desparetly in need of money for an operation to remove Malika's spleen and medication
    afterwards . We have no idea yet how much this will cost,
    but the operation will costs $ 2.000.  So fare we have collected 420
    dollars. The amount you see in this page is also the total of the
    first goal: get Malika to Russia to see a specialist. Now, to put things in perspective: Malika's father
      (Pope) earns $150 per month as a taxi driver. Don't be
    surprised; this is a decent income in Kyrgysztan. However, you'll
    understand this is not enough to pay hospital bills. For Russian speaking people Ниже мои данные для перевода денег: Исакова Надира, номер карты 4276380040163409 Read Russian update Information about Hereditary Spherocytosis Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a disorder of the surface, called
  the membrane, of your red blood cells. It causes your red blood cells
  to be shaped like spheres instead of flattened discs that curve
  inward. The spherical cells are less flexible than normal red blood
  cells. Malika has the severe and more rare type. Spherocytosis causes your red blood cells to break down faster than
  healthy cells do, which can lead to anemia. If spherocytosis causes
  anemia, you may appear paler than normal. Other common symptoms of
  anemia from hereditary spherocytosis can include: Symptoms fatigue shortness of breath irritability dizziness or lightheadedness increased heart rate headache heart palpitations jaundice Gallstones Cause Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a genetic defect. If you have a
  family history of this disorder, your chances of developing it are
  higher than someone who does not. People of any race can have
  hereditary spherocytosis, but it’s most common in people of Northern
  European descent. Sources: visit this website “If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want

  for many years. They sometimes sell Scott's prints at the local movie theaters. Suzy has just been diagnosed
      with breast cancer. This is both emotionally devastating, and financially horrific. Scott
  and Suzy are already struggling to catch up from a period of financial
  hardship, and this is a mighty blow. What can you do? Spread the word . PLEASE tell others about this fundrazr effort. If even 20 people can
  give $5, that's food for a week. If 20 people give $10, that's the
  electric bill. Sheer numbers matter. Donate. Any amount helps. Truly. Mortgage companies
  won't take partial payments, so sometimes that $3 that is all you or a
  friend can afford can make a huge difference. Pray . However you talk to the Force, please do. Remind people about the fundraiser. They may mean to make a donation,
  but need to wait till payday and then forget. It will take all of us. You'll likely have noticed my name isn't in here. That's because I'm
  not important in this, I'm merely getting things going. I've known
